          <h2 class="heading-5">What is NFT staking? </h2>
          <p class="paragraph-10">NFT staking is a method where investors strive for different ways to create more value with their NFTs. In addition to speculating on an increase in value, the staking reward is also a way to earn more. When talking about NFTs, digital images often come to mind, such as CryptoPunks or the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, but not only images can be used as NFTs. NFTs can demonstrate digital ownership of both physical and online products.  When suspending NFTs, investors can lock their NFTs on suited platforms or protocols. Locking NFTs ensures investors that they receive rewards. These so-called staking rewards provide an extra return, while the investor remains the owner of the NFT. This method is often compared to yield farming, in which crypto currencies are lent or deposited in liquidity pools to earn rewards through interest or transaction costs. Saving at the bank also resembles an NFT staking, but the major difference lies in the central character. Banks are a lot more central than the NFT platforms that offer NFT staking.</p>

              <h2 class="heading-5">How does NFT staking work?</h2>
              <p class="paragraph-10">Because both cryptocurrencies and NFTs are tokenized assets, both options can be staked. However, this is not possible on every platform for both cryptocurrencies and NFTs. The blockchain on which the tokenized asset is located, for example, plays a role in this. In the first instance, the discontinuation of NFTs is very similar to the discontinuation of crypto, but nothing could be further from the truth.  This makes it easy to sell cryptocurrencies to another party, and they can also be purchased very easily. There are millions to trillions of different tokens, with thousands to millions of people trading these coins. With NFTs, however, you are looking for specific buyers who would like to buy exactly that one NFT. This makes it difficult to sell NFTs, which can actually be positive for NFT staking. If an owner can’t get their NFT sold, and if he has the right NFT, he can still make a profit by staking the NFT.  When staking it is important that you have a crypto wallet. After all, you need a safe place where you can place the NFT after the sale. The underlying network is important here. Your crypto wallet and the NFT itself must be able to work properly on the blockchain that you would like to use. Despite the differences, the actions of staking NFTs or cryptocurrencies are similar. On your suitable platform, look for the staking section, and then stake the NFT in this section.</p>

                  <h2 class="heading-5">Rewards for staking NFT&#x27;s.</h2>
                  <p class="paragraph-10">The rewards for discontinuing NFTs can be very different. For example, it is possible to earn certain tokens, but it is also possible to earn NFTs. In addition, the frequency of the payout is also different. It is therefore wise to thoroughly investigate these aspects beforehand. Regardless of the reward, there is always a way to convert this reward into fiat money. If this is you, you can convert your crypto and NFTs into dollars!  NFT staking platforms are decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), where the NFT holders can stake their NFT. By staking in this DAO pool, also known as staking pool, holders can then participate in managerial tasks. This allows you, for example, to make proposals within the DAO, or to vote on other people’s proposals. If you want to strike NFTs and go for influence or hard hitting is completely up to you, where a combination of the two is also possible.</p>

                  <h2 class="heading-5">What is DeFi? </h2>
                  <p class="paragraph-10">As mentioned above, DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance. It is a global system that is accessible to everyone. Financial products, as we know them today, have an expiration date. Relatively new developments and trends, such as crypto, NFTs, blockchain and Web3, will put an end to the traditional forms that we have known for centuries.  By applying decentralized networks and blockchains, financial products and services are transformed into a more transparent form. Intermediaries are no longer needed and the platforms, protocols and dApps can now be managed technologically. Smart contracts also come into play here; if you want to know more about this, read this article.  With decentralized finance you can take matters into your own hands and trade on the blockchain, ensure business, grant credit, secure money issuance, strike, make payments and receive payments and build and manage your wealth. Perhaps the most important fact of all is that there is no central authority to exert influence. It’s all open-source and transparent, making it available to anyone, whenever you want. Transactions are approved through a peer-to-peer network.</p>

                  <h2 class="heading-5">What is CeFi?</h2>
                  <p class="paragraph-10">CeFi was the standard before DeFi was invented. CeFi stands for Centralized Finance. In the case of centralized finance, all crypto trades are handled via a central exchange, so they are also those in power. You don’t have your own wallet with a private key, but everything is owned by someone else.  The stock exchange is therefore the one that exerts influence on the fees and the offer in currency. It seems obvious to me that this is not the most ideal way of doing business. That’s why DeFi was developed. You can recognize the central exchanges by their KYC policy and the AML policy. KYC stands for Know Your Customer, so an identity check, and AML stands for Anti Money Laundering.  There are large CeFi providers that are quite vulnerable with all the associated consequences. These are the three main causes that can cause such a party to fall or collapse:  Returns too high – credit providers offer high returns, which are sometimes completely out of context. A good example of how things can go wrong is the investment of CeFi providers in the risky Terra; a crash to remember. Due to this collapse, the lenders were unable to pay out users’ returns; Lack of collateral – loans with too little collateral are a risk in itself. The financial risks are skyrocketing, which can have negative consequences for users; Non-transparent business – where DeFi works with smart contracts and governance forums, CeFi cannot be followed publicly. Privatization and bookkeepers behind closed doors have control over your coins.</p>

                      <h2 class="heading-5">Differences between DeFi and CeFi.</h2>
                      <p class="paragraph-10">So, what are the main differences between DeFi and CeFi? Here are the main differences:  With CeFi it is possible to trade from fiat to crypto, while this is not possible with DeFi; Non-custodial means that you have control over your own wallet + seed phrase. This is not the case with CeFi, but it is with DeFi; DeFi does not (yet) have many cross-chain solutions, while this is the case with CeFi, as described above; At DeFi you do not have to deal with KYC procedures, but CeFi must comply with current laws and regulations.</p>
