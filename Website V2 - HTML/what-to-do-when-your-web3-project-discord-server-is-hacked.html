          <h2 class="heading-5">Discord server security</h2>
          <p class="paragraph-10">Large numbers of spammers can flood your server with low-quality content to distract administrators and moderators from threats, as well as flood your server logs with events such as role assignments and members joining to hide the changes they make. This is sometimes referred to as a server raid. They may also post unapproved links in an attempt to steal community member credentials and tokens. Always configure the following settings to help protect your server from this: Choose the Highest option in Safety Setup so that only Discord accounts with a verified phone number can join your server Set up Rules Screening so that all members must perform manual actions before posting messages, decreasing the ability for bots to post unwanted content Do not allow any users except for moderators and administrators to post links, including bots, unless this is absolutely necessary for verification or security Configure the AutoMod feature to Block Spam Content in all public channels</p>

            <div class="article-body-column w-col w-col-11">
              <h2 class="heading-5">Permissions</h2>
              <p class="paragraph-10">Two-factor authentication (using authenticator apps that generate six-digit codes, such as Google Authenticator on Android OS or iOS) should be enabled on every account that can use or post to announcement channels. All moderators and administrators should revoke (and not grant) permissions for other apps to administrate your server or post as them. Try using a test Discord account on your server to post links and perform other actions that can be abusive, or use the View Server as Role feature if your test account can’t join your server because it doesn’t have a verified phone number.</p>

                  <h2 class="heading-5">Audit</h2>
                  <p class="paragraph-10">If you know of an individual or team that can be trusted to secure your server or verify that it has been secured, and you have time to schedule an audit, it’s worth the time and cost to have them identify risks. If you want to have a good understanding of what permissions could put your server at risk, the auditor joins you in a screen share so you can make the changes yourself. The auditor should check for the following, and more: Bots and integrations that are not widely used, or clones of popular ones. Webhooks and announcement channel following that can deliver bad content. Verify that bots can’t assign roles that let users post announcements or view private channels.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-10">Designate administrators or senior moderators to monitor logs for administrator activities to see if bots or other administrators are performing suspicious tasks, such as granting elevated permissions. Some bots can post specific log entries to a channel.</p>

                  <h2 class="heading-5">Here are some good security tips from Discord folks themselves:</h2>
                  <p class="paragraph-10">Never let yourself be persuaded to reveal your authentication token. With your token, malicious users can sign in and take over your account. Never share any info from the Discord’s Developer Console — you likely will never need to open it anyway. Stay away from “Free Nitro” giveaways. “Discord will never ask you to scan a QR code in order to redeem a Nitro code. Do not scan any QR codes from people you don’t know or those you can’t verify as legitimate.” Enable 2-Factor Authentication. Help fight scams by using the red “Report Spam” button at the top of DMs. And, yes: never give your password to anyone.</p>
